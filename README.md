# heart-disease-xgboost
The primary goal of this project is to build a machine learning model capable of predicting the presence of heart disease in patients based on a variety of clinical and physiological features. Early and accurate detection of heart disease is critical for timely medical intervention and can significantly reduce fatal outcomes.
